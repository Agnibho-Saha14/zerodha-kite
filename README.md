# Zerodha Kite Clone

A lightweight web frontend inspired by Zerodha Kite, designed to display financial data from Yahoo Finance. This project provides a dashboard to display data for 10 companies.

## Features

- Fetches data from Yahoo Finance.
- Displays real-time data for selected companies in a user-friendly dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or above recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agnibho-Saha14/zerodha-kite.git
cd zerodha-kite
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Using Nodemon for Development

[Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a helpful tool for automatically restarting the server when file changes are detected. If you don't already have it installed globally, you can install it with:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

To start the development server with Nodemon, run:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

### 4. Access the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>
```

Replace `<PORT>` with the port number specified in your application (default is usually `3000`).
